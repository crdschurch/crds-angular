<h2>Here is what you need to know as group connector.</h2>
<p>
    This means we'll list your name on the site so that other people in your group can signup to
    serve with you. Note that this does not mean that you're leading a project - you're just helping your community all end up on the same project. Next,
    you'll be choosing the type of work you and your friends will be doing. Please make sure you know everyone's kid's ages before you choose. The restrictions
    must be enforced for safety reasons (you don't want your friend to get sent home because you chose Construction and they brought their 2 year old!).
