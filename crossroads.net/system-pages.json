To live as He lived. Heal as He healed. Free others the way He freed us. But how do we actually move in that direction? How do we get up from an inspiring weekend service to experiencing radical, daily life change, and helping others experience the same?\r\n\r\nAt Crossroads, we’re throwing our weight behind a discipleship culture. It’s our way of resourcing people (aka potential disciples) to continually grow in their relationship with Jesus, and to take Him into their homes, marriages, neighborhoods, spheres of influence, racquetball courts, everywhere. So, from Huddles to GO Groups to homes, we are pounding the pavement. And we believe that a thriving community of maturing Jesus followers will transform Cincinnati into a landscape of freedom and power.","stateName":"discipleship","legacyStyles":1},{"title":"Videos","url":"/videos","description":"View all past and current videos at Crossroads.","stateName":"media.videos","legacyStyles":1},{"title":"Atrium Events","url":"/atriumevents","description":"Atrium Displays for today's events","stateName":"atriumEvents","legacyStyles":1},{"title":"Search Results","url":"/groups/search/results","description":"RELATIONSHIPS ARE CRITICAL TO GROWTH.

So GO Cincinnati it is, and this is how we do it: a one-day compassion blitz, investing our love into hundreds of work projects all over town. \r\n \r\nIn 2012, 6,000 of us from 50 churches got dirty and sweaty, with paint-splattered hands and mulch-stained shirts, at one of hundreds of projects. And while all the projects were different, one similarity stood out: everyone helped bring hope and life to something that previously seemed hopeless and lifeless. New flowers replaced weeds. Vibrant murals covered dirty walls.","stateName":"gocincinnati","legacyStyles":1},{"title":"Reset Password","url":"/reset-password","description":"Need to reset your password?
