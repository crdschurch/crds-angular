-- This procedure is intended to be run daily to find orphaned donations that should be
-- linked with an existing pledge.  Orphaned donations can occur in two scenarios:
--
-- 1. A donation is not linked with a pledge until the Donation_Status is Succeeded or
-- Deposited (i.e., wait for Stripe).  Prior to that, the Pledge_ID should remain null.
--
-- 2. A person can donate to a campaign prior to making a pledge to that campaign.  For
-- example, I can donate to a campaign for 12 months, then decide to make a pledge.  Once
-- my pledge has been created, we want to go back and link all previous donations to my
-- new pledge.
--
-- The implementation below will look back 4 years based on conversations with Nick.
-- Campaigns can remain open up to 3 years, so we'll go back 4 years just to be safe.
